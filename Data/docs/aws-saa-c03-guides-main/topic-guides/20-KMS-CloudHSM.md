# Section 20: KMS & CloudHSM

## The idea

Encryption is easy to say and hard to do well — the hard part is never the math, it's **key management**: where do keys live, who can use them, how do you rotate them, and how do you prove who touched them?

Picture a **bank vault with a signing register**. **KMS** (**Key Management Service**) is the bank's shared vault: your keys live in safe-deposit boxes, the bank's staff (AWS) run the vault, almost every AWS service knows how to walk up to it, and **every single time a key is used, it's written in the register** — that register is **CloudTrail**, and that audit trail is **KMS's superpower**. **CloudHSM** is different: it's you renting an **entire private vault room** — dedicated hardware, your rules, and even the bank staff **cannot see inside**.

Spell out the jargon: **KMS** stores and manages **encryption keys** centrally; it integrates with essentially every AWS service (S3, EBS, RDS, Lambda env vars...). **HSM** = **Hardware Security Module**, a tamper-resistant physical device that performs crypto operations.

## KMS key types

| Type | Cost | Rotation | Control |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AWS-managed** (`aws/s3` etc.) | free | automatic | none — AWS runs it |
| **Customer-managed key (CMK)** | **$1/month** | **optional auto-rotation (yearly)** | full: your key policy, disable/delete |
| **AWS-owned** | invisible | — | none; shared across accounts, you never see it |

Need control — your own key policy, cross-account grants, rotation you can point to in an audit → **customer-managed key**.

**Key policies + IAM: BOTH must allow.** Access to use a key = the **key policy** says yes **and** the caller's **IAM policy** says yes. A user with `kms:*` in IAM still gets denied if the key policy doesn't permit them.

## Envelope encryption — the ≤4KB rule

**KMS will only directly encrypt data up to 4KB.** For anything bigger, use the **GenerateDataKey** pattern (**envelope encryption**):

```
 You: "GenerateDataKey" ──▶ KMS
 KMS returns: ┌─ plaintext data key  (use it to encrypt your 100MB locally, then discard)
              └─ encrypted data key  (store it next to the ciphertext)
 Decrypt later: send encrypted data key ─▶ KMS unwraps it ─▶ decrypt locally
```

The big data never travels to KMS; KMS only wraps/unwraps the small **data key**. "Encrypt a large file with KMS" → **envelope encryption / GenerateDataKey**, never "KMS encrypts it directly".

## Deletion, multi-Region, and Bucket Keys

**THE trap: there is NO immediate key deletion.** Scheduling deletion imposes a **mandatory 7–30 day waiting period** (default 30). Any answer that "deletes the KMS key immediately" is wrong — deleting a key makes everything it encrypted unrecoverable, so AWS forces you to wait. Need to stop use *right now*? **Disable** the key (instant, reversible).

**Multi-Region keys**: the **same key material** replicated into other Regions with matching key IDs — **encrypt in one Region, decrypt in another**. The use cases: **DynamoDB global tables, cross-Region disaster recovery**, client-side encryption for globally moving data.

**S3 Bucket Key recap**: instead of one KMS call per object, S3 uses a short-lived bucket-level key → **far fewer KMS API calls → cheaper** (KMS request costs drop ~99%), at the price of **coarser CloudTrail audit granularity** (you see bucket-key events, not one event per object).

## CloudHSM — when the shared vault isn't enough

**CloudHSM** = **dedicated, single-tenant** hardware security modules in your VPC.

- **FIPS 140-2 LEVEL 3** validated — **KMS is Level 2**. The moment a question says "Level 3", the answer is CloudHSM. (FIPS 140-2 is the US government's crypto-module security standard; Level 3 adds physical tamper-resistance requirements.)
- **YOU manage the keys; AWS has no access to them** — AWS manages the hardware only.
- Use cases: strict **regulatory/compliance** mandates, **BYOK**-style full key custody, **SSL/TLS offload**, running your own certificate authority.

**Decision rule:** "AWS must not be able to access the keys" / "FIPS 140-2 Level 3" / "dedicated hardware" → **CloudHSM**. Everything else — integration, audit, low cost, ease → **KMS**.

## Question patterns

> *"Security team must audit every use of an encryption key."* → **KMS + CloudTrail** (every key use is logged — KMS's superpower).

> *"Encrypt a 100MB file using KMS."* → **Envelope encryption via GenerateDataKey** (KMS only encrypts ≤4KB directly).

> *"A compromised key must be deleted immediately."* → **Impossible — 7–30 day mandatory waiting period; disable it now instead**.

> *"Compliance requires FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated modules."* → **CloudHSM** (KMS is Level 2).

> *"Keys must be inaccessible even to AWS."* → **CloudHSM** (single-tenant, customer-controlled).

> *"Encrypt data in us-east-1, decrypt the same ciphertext in eu-west-1 (DR/global tables)."* → **KMS multi-Region keys**.

> *"Keys must rotate automatically every year under company control."* → **Customer-managed key with auto-rotation enabled**.

> *"KMS request costs exploded from millions of S3 objects with SSE-KMS."* → **Enable S3 Bucket Key** (fewer KMS calls; accept coarser audit).

> *"User has full IAM KMS permissions but still gets AccessDenied on a key."* → **Key policy doesn't allow them — BOTH key policy and IAM must permit**.
